# Hackathon2019 

## Coding problems

During the event we will be solving a set of problems with a particular focus on computational biology. The following exercises will cover algorithmic design and automated data analysis tasks: 

1. [**Counting DNA Nucleotides**](./problem-1/README.md)

Count the number nucleotides from a given DNA sequence.

2. [**Calculating Protein Mass**](./problem-2/README.md)

Calculate protein mass from a given protein sequence.

3. [**Finding a Motif in DNA**](./problem-3/README.md)

Find a specific motif within a DNA sequence.

4. [**Rabbits and Recurrence Relations**](./problem-4/README.md)

How many rabbits there are?

5. [**Automated submission of analyses to online servers**](./problem-5/README.md)

Construct a Python script that automatically submits fasta files to the [SignalP 4.1 Server](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), which predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in aminoacid sequences. Scripts that are able to navigate through web pages are called "web crawlers" and are very useful for many applications!
